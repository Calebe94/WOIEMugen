Legacy read me

This took a lot of work to make fellas so enjoy and please give feedback
also this screenpack is open source,but if youre going to use something
ask for permission first and give credit,this is my gem,so dont be an asshole

the portrait order goes like this:

9000,0 = small
9000,1 = big
9000,2 = win and vs
9000,3 = lifebar
9000,4 = team lifebar

there is a 150+ characters that have portraits made by me
you can find the ports in the ports and templates folder
there are all the templates for the screenpack

Custom things you can do:

*you can have images for stage select
 there is a folder in the ports area
 thats has a few pre-made ports for the
 stages,in order to use images in stage
 select,in the data folder select the version
 that says custom,either big roster or small,
 the is a stage font map to tell you how to
 change them,open the stage font in fighter factory
 to change them

*you can change the press start intro art and
 the main menu art,templates are included and
 some pre-made ports thanks to a few guys at 
 mugen figthers guild

*there's 2 versions of the lifebars,one with the 
 powerbars on top(default) and one with the power
 bars on the bottom,you can choose it on the data
 folder

*you can choose from 3 announcers
 sfxt,ssf4 and kof13

*you have 2 roster types big and small,the difference
 is they have different small portraits,9000,0
