Char: Superman (remixed edition)
Autor: Hannibal and Kal-Elvis
Version: 0.5
Sprites, palettes and sounds: Hannibal and Kal-Elvis, with help from 
           McCready, Buyog, Magus, GreatTeacherTroy, Enzo, Bobstarsky, JOR-EL, LGNB
Code: Hannibal and Kal-Elvis (aprendiendo sobre la marcha)

What is new:
Palettes - before there were more basic palettes that, while good, didn't cover the
   more subtle costume differences and in some cases couldn't reproduce them at all.
      Therefore, ALL sprites of Superman were recolored *extensively* to allow for the
        other costumes to be palettes, for fellow fans of the character.  Now EVERY 
          palette included has a story or purpose to the Superman mythos
      Also, you'll find that most of the palettes have different Clark Kent clothes as
         well, which you can find by playing Superman vs Superman.

Sprites - before, he was mostly Magneto, Cyclops, and Guile (the head of Guile).  Now,
     all heads are custom-done, and he has been lengthened so as to appear more heroic
       as is fitting to Superman.  Also, sprites with a Cyclops base were thickened to
         match the others  (still may be some of those to do, but most were fixed)
           Also, *most* of his hypers have an updated look to them, but it makes some
            of Bizarro's hypers look odd since it uses Superman's picture (FOR NOW)

Attacks - his fierce punch and kick are different now, he has a new move (identified
      below), and his hypers, which were more Street Fighter Alpha style before, are
        now executed in the more Marvel Vs Capcom fashion of quarter circles and 
           multiple punches and kicks.

Super breath - d,db,b,p (lp is freeze breath)
