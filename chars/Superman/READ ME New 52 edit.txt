-Superman New 52 V 0.91-

-Added Aerial Fwd dash and Aerial Back Dash
-New low Mid kick



Note that it is not 100% done. 
Due to my extreme inexperience with coding and mugen in general, I am expecting plenty of bugs and gameplay mechanics 
oversights.

What started out as a simple private re-spriting project turned out to be so much more.
I thought to myself that i would be respriting his costume and be done with it. Then i started to tinker with the 
animations,next thing i knew i was dabbling into coding (Mainly look at what other people have done, change it a 
little bit and put it in there). I consider none of these codes to be my original work. I guess frankencoding would be
my word for it.

I expect that after seeing Man of Steel and as more  New 52 Superman things comes out I hope that i will be able to adapt 
what I see there into this Mugen character.


Known bugs:
-Some characters get bugged w/ lv3 hyper. They will get uppercut but fall down soon after.
-Some charaters when frozen cannot be hit w/ ->, <-, ->,Y move.
