WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
CHARACTER PROFILE & BACKGROUND
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

Real Name: Diana
Occupation : Ambassador, teacher, super-hero, secret agent
Alias: Wonder Woman; Princess of Themyscira ; Diana Prince
Birthplace: Themyscira - Greek
Height: 5' 11'
Weight: 140 lbs
Eyes: Blue, (current Athena's Gray eyes)
Hair: Black


-She is the reincarnated spirit of a human child who died in her mother's
womb almost 30,0000 years ago, brought to life by several Greek goddesses.
They funneled the spirit into a clay sculpture crafted by Hippolyta, bringing
it to life

-Granted the strenght of Gaea, the Earth itself, Wonder Woman is one of the
strongest heroes on the planet, along with Superman, Martian Manhunter, and
Captain Marvel. She also can fly at supersonic speeds. 

-A master of ancient and modern martial skills.
Diana is also an accomplished archer, swordsman, and an expert tracker and swimmer.

- Diana possesses a great empathy with the animal world. She can communicate
with many kinds of animals, and her mere presence often brings the most ferocious
among them to an absolute calm.

- Wonder Woman often dons ceremonial battle armor, created by the artisan Pallas,
when tackling powerful adversaries.

-For a small amount of time, she even experienced divine transcendence and joined
her gods as one of them, the Goddess of Truth. 

--------Wonder Woman weapons----------------
- Bracelets
Diana silver bracelets were created from the remains of Zeus Aegis shield.
The bracelets are unbreakable and generate a small energy field.

- Invisible jet
Dome Its a alien being that was part of a larger consciousness called "the Ring".
The Lansanarians (a race Diana helped in the past)  gave the alien technology
to Diana as a gift.
It linked mentally  to Wonder Woman and became a transparent, morphing weapon,
primarily  taking  on the shape of an invisible plane.

- Magic Lasso
Aka Hestia's Lasso of Truth.
Forged from the golden girdle of gaea by Hephaestus, the rope is virtually
indestructible. It glows as if on fire and those bound within the lasso
are forced to tell the absolute truth.

- Gauntlet of Atlas
Amplifies the strenght of its wearer by ten

- Sandals of Hermes
Allowed her to teleport between Themyscira and  Patriarch's World (ours).

- Golden Tiara
Dianas tiara is razor-sharp and can be used as a throwing weapon, 
like a boomerang or to slice through objects as tough as steel.
Another gift of the gods

===================== INTRO  & ENDING  SECTION  ============================================

- Sprite edits and code by Loganir
- except Ares full face portrait on ending sequence /  by McCready
- except Artemis edit on the greek collum in the final ending section  /  by X-Fields

Music for the intro  by Yasunori Mitsuda ///  Music for the ending  by  Michiru Yamane.

obs:
Well, I tried work on something  iconic for W.W. on the intro & ending. 
Too many people dont know her strong bounds with Greek mythology.

So everything its focused in the events created by George Perez reboot for the character, way back on 1987.
I also did some reference to Hyppolita's death from Phil Jimenez arcs.
Of course the timeline for this events are different, but think about the ending like a "elseworlds" stuff ;)

The ending/intro contains excerpts from Phil Jimenez, John Byrne and George Pérez works for Wonder Woman.
Many kudos to all and the glory of Gaea be with these guys.

Oh yeah, Im lazy to transform one A.Hughes artwork  to pixel art in the intro  :P
maybe for the next update ;)
