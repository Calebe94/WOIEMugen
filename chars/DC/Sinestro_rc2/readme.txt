!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Things that will hack me off related to the use of this character:
- Don't host it on your site unless you ASK first, and give us the
    proper credit. Email isn't hard, and I'll probably say yes,
    so don't be afraid to ask. =P
- If you got this character from somewhere other than ScruffyDragon.com 
    or my site, Buyog.com, it's quite possible that it's been hacked and/or modified
    without my permission, and not all the moves and animations may be very good.
    Best to get it from a trusted source and be confident in its integrity.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


GAMEPLAY:

Sinestro's got a 6-button play style:

x - Weak Punch (WP)
y - Medium Punch (MP)
z - Hard Punch (HP)
a - Weak Kick (WK)
b - Medium Kick (MK)
c - Hard Kick (HK)

d,u:  Super Jump (KKK will trigger it too)
f,f:  Dash Forward (PPP will also work)
b,b:  Dash Back (PPP while holding back will also do the trick)


NOTE
Sinestro was developed entirely on WinMUGEN; I have no idea if he'll even work right in MUGEN 1.0,
I haven't tested him there yet. If it works for you, great; if not, please let me know.


SPECIALS
 - Deadly Gaze: QCF + P

COMBO SYSTEM

Capcom-style chain combos work for standing, crouching, and air:
1. WP+MP+SP: you can chain the three punches together, weakest to strongest, for a 3 or 4 hit combo.
2. WK+MK+SK: like the punches, you can chain the three kicks together as well.
3. (in air) WP+WK+MP+MK+SP: The basic "zigzag" combo. Chains up to 6 hits.

Launcher: crouching hard punch (standing hard punch can OTG)
