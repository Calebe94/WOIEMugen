        --==*** Supergirl ***==--
           -=================- v1.0 by Toni


Hello everyone. Thanks for downloading my Supergirl. After lots of tweaking, here she is, finally finished. I hope that you'll enjoy her. :)

Despite the similar looks, this version of Supergirl is based on her cartoon incarnation, Kara In-Ze, not Linda Danvers from the comics. If you don't find this Supergirl to be comic-accurate, this is probably why.

This character is compatible with both DOS- and WinMugen.


--==  What's in?  ==--

- Pretty much everything a character needs to have.
- Special winposes against Superman, Wonder Woman, Lex Luthor and Green Lantern John Stewart.


--==  New in v1.0  ==--

- More audible winquotes.
- Air-throw added.
- Rebalanced some of her attacks.
- AI is more willing to use aerial attacks.
- New taunt
- New intro
- Many, many other small fixes here and there.


--==  What's left?  ==--

- Special intro against Batgirl.
