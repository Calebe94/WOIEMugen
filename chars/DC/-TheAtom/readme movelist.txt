////////////////:Profile:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------------------
Name: Ray Palmer
Ht:   5'10"
Wt:   180 pounds

~Powers and abilities~
Ray Palmer creates a belt tool from what was initially depicted
as white dwarf star matter, which allows him to shrink down to
subatomic size. In addition, he develops new equipment that allows
him to instantly alter his molecular density to whatever degree he
desires. This allows him to glide on air currents on a low setting,
while a high setting allows him to handle or strike objects with the
equivalent strength of his normal size and build. A favorite travel
method is to call some location on the telephone  and when the intended
phone is answered, Palmer can shrink down enough to literally travel
through the phone lines in seconds to emerge out of the answering phone.
