Okay, if you haven't guessed yet, this is just a cheapo joke character. 
He's insanely tough, with highly restricted super armor.
He has only one move, the Omega Blast, which is insanely brutal... it's unblockable, and it normally takes 500 health (that's half for most characters)
If the opponent is blocking they have a bit better odds, but not by much... the Omega Blast still hits, but only does 300 damage in that case.

Answers to the inevitable questions about this character:

1. Will this be what the "real" Darkseid looks like?

Maybe; we're not 100% sure yet.

2. Hey! He doesn't have all the MUGEN required sprites, so the screen is full of debug error messages!

Is that a question? Anyway, yes, we know... repeat after me, "HE'S A JOKE CHARACTER!" Just play with him in regular MUGEN without the debugging info turned on.

3. Can I modify this char to make a "real" Darkseid?

For personal use, sure, knock yourself out. Heck, if you want, let us know about your modifications, and you might even earn a spot on the Scruffy Dragon development team if they're good enough. :)
But please, don't re-release this guy to the public without our knowledge; that's just tacky. (Almost as tacky as releasing a joke character with only one anim! But I digress...)
