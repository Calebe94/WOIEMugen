Matthew Murdock AKA DareDevil of Hell's Kitchen

Abandoned by his mother, Matt Murdock was raised by his father, boxer "Battling Jack" Murdock, in Hell's Kitchen. 
Realizing that rules were needed to prevent people from behaving badly, young Matt decided to study law however,
when he saved a man from an oncoming truck, it spilled a radioactive cargo that rendered Matt blind while enhancing his remaining senses. 
Under the harsh tutelage of blind martial arts master Stick, Matt mastered his heightened senses and became a formidable fighter.
Matt earned his Juris Doctorate degree, his father was murdered by agents of the Fixer for refusing to throw a fight. 
Enraged when the legal system failed to bring the Fixer to justice, Matt donned a costume made from his father's boxing robe 
and went into action, savagely beating his father's killers and frightening the Fixer himself to death. 
Establishing a small New York law firm with his best friend Foggy Nelson, Matt vowed to serve the law as Matt Murdock 
and to fight evils beyond the law's reach as "The Devil of Hell's Kitchen" better known as Daredevil


This is the first release of DareDevil, i've tried making many incarnations of this character, but all seem to feel generic, and half hearted,
So this year, I had put my full attention to making a Matt Murdock i could be happy with, heavily based on bases of Adon, Cyclops, 
along with Urien, Cable and Eagle, i was able to conjure up enough sprites to put my old failed Daredevil works aside
i took ideas from the Marvel Nemesis: rise of the imperfects and tried to incorporate all the athletic aspects of a character that daredevil posesses
hence why he can walljump, double jump, super jump, and air dash (via his baton styled swing)  
 
kudos to Nicotinefist and Alan Joestar for some help with spritework way early on this WIP project and MMV team who also helped with the first few attempts
and Acey for helping and with the template help and general coding guidance
