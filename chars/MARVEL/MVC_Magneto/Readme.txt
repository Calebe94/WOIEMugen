--- What's this? ---

This is my first attemp to do a character for M.U.G.E.N:
Magneto from Marvel Super Heroes and Xmen vs. Street Fighter.

To use it, unzip all the files into a sub-directory to the directory where you keep the
M.U.G.E.N engine called "chars\Magneto" and add the character to your
character roster by simply adding the line "Magneto" to your "select.cfg"
under the [Characters] section.

--- What´s new to this version? --- 

* Added 3 level power for shockwave
* Some bug fixes.

--- What´s new to this Magneto? --- 

* More frames than the original, and much more planned to be in the final version.
* Has most combos of the original, even aerial combos, but you need to play on tall stages.

--- What´s left? ---

* Some getting hit frames.
* Fix magnetic Tempest.
* Fix bugs on shockwave.
* Add new moves.
* Fix aerial combos.
* Add gem system from MSH.
* Anything else what i could forget.

--- STORY ---

Erik Magnus Lensherr was born into a world of Nazi brutality; of course, the
Nazis' prejudice also had to include mutants, so at a very young age, he was
placed in a Nazi death camp. Learning that only the strong survive, Magnus
took the idea to heart when his mutant control over magnetism surfaced. He
began a world crusade for mutantkind, determined to make homo sapiens pay for
their prejudice against homo superior, and in truth ended up following the
same discriminative ideals of the Nazis. He is considered to be THE most
dangerous mutant alive, and is the arch-enemy of the famed X-Men, the
organization of mutants lead by Charles Xavier to find a friendly way to live
with humans in harmony. Recently a band of mutants known as the Acolytes
pledged their total alligience to Magneto, and currently lives and plots in
an artificial satellite of his own design, dubbed Asteriod M.
His mission? To allow all mutants to live peacefully, in a world that is
"rightfully theirs".
