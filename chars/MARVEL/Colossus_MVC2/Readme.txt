Release: Feburary 19 2007
Update:

First of all would like to thank the people that aided me to make him how he is now.
I wouldn't be able to make him without help of making and hosting him:
- Elecbyte for Mugen.
- Wuwo from Mugen China for Colossus's sprites.
- Nobuyuki for sprites, coding, and  effects.
- Kung Fu Man, Some of Super Armor Code.
- P.O.T.S. for his Tips and Tutourial on Get Hit Sounds.
- Winane,Cyanide, and other people helping me in the Creation Help Section.
- Snake, for some Palettes.
- Nono, for some Palettes.
- Everyone at the Mugen Guild Forum, Mgbr, Mugen-Infantry, Randomselect, Mugen China.

This Colossus is not a perfect conversion of the Marvel Versus Capcom 2, 
nor should you expect him.
