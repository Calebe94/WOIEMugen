This is the official alpha release of Nightwing Mugen character.
We are releasing this character at such a raw stage because of the stolen
version that got out. So, with some small bug fixes, paletes, some combos added and 
opening/ending featured we hope the stolen version isn't usefull for anything
anymore.

What is done?
----------------------------------------------
Basics - still need a LOT of fixes

We'd like to thank everyone who didn't download the stolen version.
Thank you for your support

Enjoy.



Special Thanks to: Magus and the DCvM team and supporters.
