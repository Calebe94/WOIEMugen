CHARACTER PROFILE & BACKGROUND
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

To understand who are the God of Thunder, a little pick from the Norse Mythology version
and the Marvel version. 
_________________________________________________________________________
MYTHOLOGY VERSION:  The son of Odin and Jord.  Thor is the god of thunder and
lightning, which he unleashes with each strike of his hammer, Mjolnir.  He is
the most powerful of the gods, even surpassing Odin in strength.  He is a
large, muscular man with a red beard and eyes of lightning.  One of the most
popular gods as a protector of both gods and humans alike, he surpassed Odin
in popularity because he didn't require human sacrifices.  And also unlike
Odin, he was much more trustworthy.  During Ragnarok, he will kill Jormungand,
the Midgard Serpeant, but will also die from it's poison.  He is married to
Sif, a fertility goddess, and his symbol is the Swastika. (Don't give me that
look!  It's true!)
FROM: Gamefaqs - Norse Mythology by Hexum - nixhexus@yahoo.com / Valkyrie Profile section
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
MARVEL VERSION: True to his mythological foundation, the comic book Thor was not what one might consider a "quick study." 
The Son of Odin, though overflowing with bravery and determination, lacked the intelligence and wit to save himself from 
dastardly plans in both the myths and in the comics.

Thor could not possibly blend with other heroes of Marvel continuity without first donning a standard costume; to create 
the proper appearance for the mighty Thor, artist Jack Kirby researched the tales surrounding the Norse god. A dominant 
feature of Thor's costume was his helmet, which featured the large wings of an eagle. Clearly, eagle wings were widely 
recognized as symbols of Viking warfare; perhaps Kirby saw these artifacts and was inspired to design Thor's helmet in 
such a fashion. 
Perhaps Thor's most important costume specification was his red cape, which placed him high above the other early heroes 
in the Marvel Universe; the major Marvel heroes in the early 1960s, all performed their duties without wearing capes. 
By donning the red cape, Thor automatically achieved a regal status, reminiscent of royal robes or, indeed, the costume 
of DC Comics' popular Superman. 

In the comic book series, Thor never acts "holier-than-thou," because he understands that he is not the dominant force in 
reality; perhaps the greatest example concerning Thor's rank as a soldier (and not a king) would be to examine his 
relationship with his father, Odin. 
Writer Stan Lee explains, "Thor's powers allow him to operate on a grandiose, cosmic scale, yet the old Norse tales that 
Marvel adapted demanded that he be subordinate to an even greater force. Odin, the virtually omnipotent leader of the 
legendary gods, is Thor's father, and he rules with an iron hand. 
Many comic book heroes are orphans, inspired to fight crime because of the death of their parents, so Thor's somewhat 
awkward position as a dutiful son sets him apart"

THE POWERS OF THOR:
*Weather Control: By tapping the magical enchantments of his hammer Mjolnir, Thor can summon all storm elements.

*Strength: Thor can lift upwards of 100 tons, putting him in Marvel’s elite class. He also has incredible endurance,
resistance to virtually all sickness and disease and can withstand and heal practically any wound.

*Inter-dimensional Travel: Mjolnir can open inter-dimensional portals, allowing Thor to travel between Earth, Asgard
and other realms.

*Fighting: Thor is a highly skilled warrior who has had many centuries of battle to perfect his craft.
 
*Flight: Thor`s hammer, Mjolnir, is the vehicle through which Thor "flies". By throwing the hammer
and grabbing on to its mystical leather thong, Thor is propelled by the hammer into flight.
